# GearDB
## 1 Introduction
This is the implementation of the paper "**GearDB: A GC-free Key-Value Store on HM-SMR Drives with Gear Compaction**" appeared in [FAST 2019](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast19).

We implement GearDB based on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb).




## 2 Compilation and Run
We use zonefs to replace the read and write interfaces of the HM-SMR.Zonefs is a simple file system for Western Digital, and we don't know if the code can be open source.


Zonefs is a very simple file system exposing each zone of a zoned block device
as a file. zonefs does not have any on-disk metadata and does not require a
disk format before use. As such, zonefs does not require any userspace tool.



### 2.1 Tools
You should Install the zonefs kernel module, then mount zonefs under a directory.


### 2.2 Compilation and Run 

1. Add the path of your HM-SMR drive or emulated HM-SMR drive (e.g., /dev/sdb1) in file "/GearDB/hm/hm_status.h":
```
static const char smr_filename[]="/dev/sdb1";
```
2. You may need to modify all zone numbers and the first zone number in file "/GearDB/hm/hm_manager.cc". Maybe can query the directory to set them , but I think it is very low. Looking forward to using other methods.
```
void HMManager::set_all_zonenum_and_first_zonenum(uint64_t *zonenum, uint64_t *first_zonenum) {
    *zonenum = 55356;
    *first_zonenum = 524;
    //To be improved
}
```
3. We have modified the Makefile to make the compilation of GearDB same with LevelDB. 

```
> make -j4
```
3. Now you may run and test GearDB with out-static/db_bench. The "out-static/libleveldb.a." is still available in GearDB.
```
> ./out-static/db_bench
```
## 3 GearDB's differences with [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)
To get the source code of LevelDB in the same edition used by GearDB,  do the following steps:

```
> git clone https://github.com/google/leveldb
> cd leveldb
> git checkout  23162ca1c6d891a9c5fe0e0fab1193cd54ed1b4f
```
Or, you may download it at : <https://github.com/google/leveldb/tree/23162ca1c6d891a9c5fe0e0fab1193cd54ed1b4f> 

Since GearDB is implemented based on LevelDB, here we list the main differences between GearDB and LevelDB.

1. Added file: hm/*ã€‚
2. Modified file:

## 4 Acknowledgement
We thank [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) and [Libzbc](https://github.com/hgst/libzbc)! 

We used them to complete our implementation.



## 5 Attentions
This version does not support reloading databases, which means it will get an error if you open the database again after the program finished. The version supported reloading is implemented. However, it makes the operation of GearDB a little bit cumbersome. If you test GearDB with the macro-benchmark [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git), the reload function will be needed. You may contact *993096281@qq.com* to get the support for reloading a database.
